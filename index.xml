      <description>The study (or art, wisdom, science) of protecting (digital) data by mathematics. More literally, the study of writing in cipher.
Colloquially sometimes called (dark) magic, in the sense of marvel, wonder, beauty. But also in reference to the inherent abstractness of mathematical concepts.
In practice, a mathematical transformation converts plain data into an unreadable form which conceals the original data. In some scenarios, the transformation is reversible by any party possessing certain secret knowledge, and practically by no other party.</description>

      <description>I graduated with Highest Honors as MSc in Mathematics from Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg in 2017. Right after, I joined the Institute of Applied Information Process­ing and Communications Technology (IAIK) at Graz University of Technology where I mainly worked on the implementation of cryptographic algorithms in Java until 2019.
In 2019, I started my doctoral research training at IAIK as a member of the Cryptology &amp;amp; Privacy group led by Christian Rechberger.</description>
