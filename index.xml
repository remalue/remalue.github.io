      <description>The study (or art, wisdom, science) of protecting (digital) data by mathematics. More literally, the study of writing in cipher.
Colloquially sometimes called (dark) magic, in the sense of mystery, wonder, marvel, beauty. But also in reference to the inherent abstractness of mathematical concepts.
In practice, a mathematical transformation converts plain data into an unreadable form which conceals the original data. In some scenarios, the transformation is reversible by any party possessing certain secret knowledge, and practically by no other party.</description>

      <description>I am passionate about mathematics, cryptography, and the social value they generate. Up until now, many roles gave me the opportunity to put this passion into practice. From private tutor, teaching assistant and (undergraduate, graduate, doctoral) student to university teacher and (post-)doctoral cryptography researcher.
Cryptography brings mathematics to the intersection of information security and privacy. In this regard, cryptography not only protects the integrity of our data, communication, and computation but in a very direct sense also promotes our integrity as individuals and society.</description>
