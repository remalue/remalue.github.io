      <description>The study (or art, wisdom, science) of protecting (digital) data by mathematics. More literally, the study of writing in cipher.
Colloquially sometimes called (dark) magic, in the sense of mystery, wonder, marvel, beauty. But also in reference to the inherent abstractness of mathematical concepts.
In practice, a mathematical transformation converts plain data into an unreadable form which conceals the original data. In some scenarios, the transformation is reversible by any party possessing certain secret knowledge, and practically by no other party.</description>

      <description>I am passionate about mathematics, cryptography and the social value these two subjects generate. Up until now, many roles gave me the opportunity to realize this passion. From private tutor, teaching assistant and (undergraduate/graduate/doctoral) student to university teacher and (post-)doctoral cryptography researcher.
2024 Shortly after my PhD graduation and subsequent work as post-doctoral cryptography researcher in the Cryptology &amp;amp; Privacy group at IAIK, I ventured to traverse the Andean mountains by bike, from Chile to Colombia.</description>
